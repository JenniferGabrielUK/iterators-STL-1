# iterators-STL-1 - Portfolio
A series of test cases using some of the most common iterators as a showcase for my portfolio in C++.
Makes use of:
    auto 
    const_iterators with .cbeing()
    reverse iterator with .rend()
    const reverse iterator's
 The main code uses these iterators to sort through data structures such as std::vector's.
